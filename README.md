# Electrol Bonds Website #
I have created this website under my Data-Centric and Computing course taught by Prof. Mayank Singh as our Course Assignment 4. It allows the user to surf through the details of electoral bonds and their purchase and redemption details.

## Instructions To Set up The Website ##

1. Download the entire repository as a ZIP File.
2. Upload the entire folder after extracting from ZIP to VS Code and download Flask to run the files and all appropriate libraries like Python.
3. In My SQL WorkBench Import, the database is in the SQL Dump file.
4. For MY SQL WorkBench, create a user named 'root' with hostname '127.0.0.1' and port as '3306' and password to be 'Anirudh@1403'.
5. if you have changed the username and password while importing the SQL file, edit the corresponding details in the Python file 'anirudh.py.'

Now run the 'anirudh.py' python file to execute the website and to get a server link.
